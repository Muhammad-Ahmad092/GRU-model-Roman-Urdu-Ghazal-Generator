# Introduction
This project introduces an AI-powered Roman Urdu Ghazal Generator, designed using a GRU-based neural network 
trained on an extensive dataset of Urdu poetry. The model captures poetic patterns and generates fresh ghazals 
based on user-provided input.
To make poetry creation intuitive and accessible, the project includes a Streamlit-based frontend, enabling 
users to enter a word and specify the desired number of lines for automatic generation. This seamless integration
of natural language processing (NLP) and deep learning brings automated poetry composition to life, offering an 
innovative approach to computational creativity. ðŸŽ¶
